# Advanced Cricket Tournament Simulation Program using Python
## This is a Python program that simulates a cricket tournament with advanced details. It models real-world cricket matches and statistics to provide an interactive simulation.

## Methodology
The program is designed using object-oriented programming principles. It consists of the following key classes:

Player: Represents a cricket player with various statistics like bowling, batting, fielding, running, and experience.
Team: Represents a cricket team consisting of players. It has methods for selecting the captain, setting batting order, choosing bowlers, etc.
Field: Represents the cricket field with factors like size, fan ratio, pitch conditions, and home advantage.
Umpire: Simulates the game by predicting the outcome of a ball. It keeps track of scores, wickets, and overs.
Commentator: Provides commentary for each ball and over based on the match statistics.
Match: Simulates an individual cricket match. It uses objects of the Teams, Field, and Umpire classes to run the match.
The program utilises suitable data structures and algorithms, such as lists and dictionaries, to efficiently represent and manipulate tournament data. It follows Python coding conventions and best practices, including PEP 8 guidelines for code style and formatting. The code is modular and designed for reusability and maintainability.

## Instructions
To run the program, follow these steps:

Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the code: Download the Python code for the cricket tournament simulation program.

Install dependencies: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the code. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

                  pip install random
Run the program: After installing the dependencies, run the following command to start the simulation:

python cricket_tournament_simulation.py
The program will create the match simulation and display the output on the terminal.
